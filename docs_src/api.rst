===========================================

AnnotationQueryPython provides a suite of composable functions to query annotations stored as a parquet file. While the annotations will typically be generated by popular text analytic tools such as Stanford Core or Genia, the only requirement is the annotations adhere to the AQAnnotation structure. The underlying implementation leverages Datasets and Spark(SQL).
